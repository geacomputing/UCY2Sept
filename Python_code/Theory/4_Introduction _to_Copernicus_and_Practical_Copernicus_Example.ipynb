    "\n",
    "Before using the **Copernicus CDS API**, you need to authenticate using your personal API key.  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Register** on the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).\n",
    "   - Create an account (if you don‚Äôt already have one).\n",

    "\n",

    "- The **CDS API client automatically looks for this file** every time you run a data download request.  \n",
    "- This means you don‚Äôt need to manually pass your credentials in every script‚Äîjust create the `.cdsapirc` once, and the API client reads it every time.  \n",
    "- This makes working with the Copernicus CDS API **seamless and secure**, keeping your credentials private and out of your code files.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Never share your `.cdsapirc` file or include it in public repositories, as it contains your personal API key.\n",
