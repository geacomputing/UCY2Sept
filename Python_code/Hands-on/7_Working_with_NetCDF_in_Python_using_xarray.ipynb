    "# Working with NetCDF Data in Python Using xarray and CDS API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programmatically download **ERA5 reanalysis** climate data over a **long time period (15 years)**\n",
    "- Focus on a **small geographic region** to keep data size manageable\n",
    "- Load and inspect the downloaded NetCDF dataset using **xarray**\n",
    "- Extract a **time series** of temperature at a specific geographic point\n",
    "- Calculate and visualize the **temperature anomaly** relative to the long-term climatology\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Task?\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with climate and atmospheric data often involves large datasets spanning many years and geographic areas.  \n",
    "To efficiently handle and analyze this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to programmatically request only the data you need.\n",
    "- Use Python tools like **xarray** to explore, subset, and analyze data.\n",
    "- Understand how to compute anomalies which highlight deviations from average conditions, useful for climate studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Details and Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Find and Request the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit the [Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).\n",
    "- Search for the dataset named **\"ERA5 single levels\"** with the product ID:  **reanalysis-era5-single-levels**\n",
    "- This dataset provides ERA5 reanalysis data on single vertical levels, suitable for near-surface temperature and other variables.\n",
    "- Make sure to choose **NetCDF** as the output format (`\"format\": \"netcdf\"`) and `\"product_type\": \"reanalysis\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:**  \n",
    "> If you simulate a manual download through the CDS web interface, the platform shows the equivalent **API request** snippet.  \n",
    "> This snippet can be copied and expanded in your Python scripts to automate the download process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Download Data Programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the CDS API to download **daily 2m temperature data** over 15 years for a very small region.\n",
    "- Limit the time to a single daily hour (e.g., 12:00 UTC) to reduce data size.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Load and Explore the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the downloaded NetCDF file with **xarray**.\n",
    "- Inspect metadata, variables, and dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Extract a Time Series at a Specific Location\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select a point within your region and extract the temperature time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Calculate and Plot the Temperature Anomaly\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the climatological mean (daily average over years).\n",
    "- Calculate the anomaly by subtracting the climatology.\n",
    "- Visualize the anomaly time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- A local NetCDF file with ERA5 data.\n",
    "- Familiarity with CDS API requests and metadata inspection.\n",
    "- Experience in timeseries extraction and anomaly calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your `.cdsapirc` file is correctly configured with your API credentials.\n",
    "- Start with small spatial/temporal subsets for quick testing.\n",
    "- Explore xarrayâ€™s powerful time grouping and selection tools.\n",
